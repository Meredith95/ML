# Deep Network

To get deep learning to work we need very large databases.

It attempts to re-present the input pattern, obtaining a high abstraction of the data in each layer. To achieve this, each layer captures common correlations that occur in previous layers. 

## CNNs

Convolution Neural Networks are brilliant for **images**, excellent for **signals** not great for anything else. 

CNNs就干图像处理和信号处理，别的都不太行。

## RNNs

NLP, natural language processing is heavily based on recurrent neural networks

## MLPs, multi-layer perceptrons.

 In principle, multi-layer perceptrons could be made arbitrarily deep, but in practice deep MLPs were untrainable

## LSTMs 

LSTMs are widely used in time vary problems, like video interpretation.
